### **Description**
The challenge was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This application allows users to search for books. When a login and password are created, users can then save save books to their profiles and delete them when necessary.
